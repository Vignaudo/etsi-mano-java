 * NOTE: Normaly we should receive object in methods but Genson seems to be on
 * the classpath and is unable to unserialize objects. So we use a string2Object
 * to do So. Note same problems occurred when returning object some times genson
 * could be here and not Jackson, in this case you can use object2String.
